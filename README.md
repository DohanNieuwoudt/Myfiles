To whom it may concern.

As you can clearly see, there is a massive lacking in the experience department concerning my skills. 
I am very willing to make up for this lack in any way I possibly can.
Any further projects I work on I will upload and update here on github as soon as they start progressing.
Please send me feedback at your convenience to jddnwdt@gmail.com as to why I will not be accepted if that is the case.
I thank you for your time.

Kind regards.
Johannes David (Dohan) Nieuwoudt
